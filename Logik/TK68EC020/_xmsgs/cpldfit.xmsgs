It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be ignored.

<msg type="warning" file="Cpld" num="896" delta="old" >Unable to map all desired signals into function block, FB<arg fmt="%d" index="1">16</arg>, because too many function block product terms are required. Buffering output signal <arg fmt="%s" index="2">ARAM&lt;10&gt;</arg> to allow all signals assigned to this function block to be placed.
</msg>

<msg type="error" file="Cpld" num="886" delta="old" >Function block <arg fmt="%s" index="1">FB14</arg> was too congested to route successfully. This occurs due to excessive (&gt;= 50) product term input fanins to this function block. Consider moving output signals in this function block to less congested function blocks, buffering output signals that must remain in this function block, or selecting a larger package.
